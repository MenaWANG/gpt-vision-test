## ðŸ“¸ GPT Vision Quick Demo and Test
This repo serves as a quick demonstration and test of document recognition using the GPT-4 model. In this demo, we'll explore how GPT-4 can be used to analyze and interpret various types of documents, such as receipts, invoices, forms, and more. All the images/docuemnts in the repo are dummy ones found online or created for testing purposes only.

## ðŸ“„ More on Document Recognition
Document recognition, also known as document analysis or document understanding, is the process of extracting useful information from documents in various formats, including images, PDFs, and scanned documents. It involves tasks such as text extraction, entity recognition, key information extraction, and document classification.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
You'll need to 
* have the necessary dependencies installed (pls see `requirements_py311.txt`). Here is [a quick demo on creating virtual environment](https://github.com/MenaWANG/venv_test).  
* create an openai api key for the project and save it in your environment. More info on [{dotenv} for secrete management](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).
